Monitoring
----------

- Background on psetf authentication
    - Maps any IGTF x509 certificate to user
    - Maps special DNs to admin
    - Apache configuration plus minimal check_mk configuration

- Shawn recommended check_mk business intelligence
  - Shows a roll-up of status
  - Allows you to drill down into the details of what is broken
  - The whole pipeline could be an "OSG network pipeline" that's green/yellow/red
    - Could then drill down into individual components

- Derek's comments
  - OSG needs to have a separate check_mk at Nebraska
  - May have to have a focus on identifying (or writing) check_mk tests for components

- Shawn recommended check_mk >= 1.5.0p12 for monitoring of Docker/Kubernetes services

RSV and data collection
-----------------------

- Correction from Shawn:
  - `s/PerfSonar/perfSONAR/g`. It's an acronym

- New collector seems to be working fine
  - No issues noted during Nebraska network maintenance

- New pS plugin to allow host-specific includes to mesh config
  - Estimated to be included in late spring pS release

- Action items:
  - Derek: Move perfSONAR collector repo to sand-ci GitHub org
  - Derek: Make a sand-ci Docker org
  - Derek: Confirm summary records aren't being sent to the MQ
