### Sending HTCondor data to both ES instances

- Should the data go to tape? Est. around couple hundred MB/day
    - Consensus is yes!

### ESnet data

- Data: traffic (2 years); errors, discards (1 month)
- Size: About 1GB/mo
- Working on reviewing schema and moving into production
- Don't send to tape now. Wait until we're ready to move to production.
