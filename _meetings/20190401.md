Presentation from Yuan
----------------------
- Goal: Provide a more convenient way to measure network performance and detect anomalies
  - Visualize the data to make it useful for researchers
  - Currently visualize individual data sources separately
  - Goal is to visualize multiple sources: combine packet loss and traceroute
    to identify bad paths
- Focusing on pS packet loss and trace data
   - Created multiple Kibana dashboards based on ES data
- http://atlas-kibana-dev.mwt2.org/s/networking/app/kibana#/dashboards?_g=()

### Discussion
- How best to visualize the data?
- Will likely need tools outside of Kibana
- See Facebook's [NetNORAD](https://code.fb.com/core-data/netnorad-troubleshooting-networks-via-end-to-end-probing/)
- From PRP, Dima's [Traceroute Visualization Tool](https://traceroute.nautilus.optiputer.net/)
- Shawn mentioned [Tracing Internet Path Transparency](https://pub.tik.ee.ethz.ch/students/2017-FS/MA-2017-12.pdf), combines traceroutes and Neo4J

Outstanding action items
------------------------
* Service status format changes (Huijun)
  - Two tables:
    - Table of SLA services vs non-SLA services?
    - Comma-separated list of those meeting the SLAs
    - All the services in a table sorted by uptime
* Pick the four most important services and have them captured by check_mk
* Link presentations from the SAND website (Shawn)
* Find a week in May that would work for a Chicago meeting (Derek)
