Ongoing topics
--------------

### Sending HTCondor data to both ES instances
- Chicago ES is newer, and plans to use newer features (ILM)
- This incompatible with ES on the older GRACC instance
- Should the data go to tape? Est. around couple hundred MB/day
    - Consensus is yes!

### ESnet data
- Have access to SNMP (over 9022 interfaces)
- Data: traffic (2 years); errors, discards (1 month)
- Size: About 1GB/mo
- Working on reviewing schema and moving into production
- Don't send to tape now. Wait until we're ready to move to production.

### [Example use cases](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pzGCeA0o6PORJIdCEh5u7c-gfAG519SH)
- U Waterloo writeup is complete
- Purdue/FNAL, Madison, and throughput writeup is in progress
- Make a recorded session
- Convert into webpage, add to SAND website (John)

### Tape replay
- Now sending Dec 2018
- Wrote email of replay overview (John with Derek)

### XRootD TCP statistics
- Andy recommended making a plugin
- Will likely require quite a bit of plumbing (adding hooks in the right spot)
